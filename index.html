<p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
<p id="highlight">History is my <strong>passion</strong>. I am intrested in <em>U.S. foreign relations</em> during the interwar period. Currently, I am looking at the triangular relationship between the United States, Germany, and El Salvador. I am taking a social-structuralist and cultural approach to interwar diplomatic history in order to trace shifts in attitudes and U.S. foreign policy. One of the most prevelent factors affecting U.S. foreign policy is isolationsim, which led to the Nuetrality Resolutions: <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/neutrality-acts"> 1930s Nuetrality Acts.</a>
